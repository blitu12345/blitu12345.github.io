Hi, my name is Ashish Karel.


<p>
I am an avid manga reader, sci-fi reader, and loves to run my current PR is 2.1km/7minutes. I love to learn about how things work, whether that be studying good coding practices, engineering techniques, or Computer Vision methods.
</p>

<p>
Much of my experience revolves around building Computer Vision and deep learning applications, but I also strive to gain a deeper understanding of the world so that I can expand my skillset and build new and amazing things.
