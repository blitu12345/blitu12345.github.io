I'm prefinal year student at The LNM Institute Of Information Technology.

I'm mainly interested in Deep Learning especially in Computer vision and Natural Language Processing.
Passionate for data, statistics and Machine Learning.If still time persists me,then my next stop is AI(Reinforcement Learaning + multi-agent systems) and cryptocurrency(all hail to Satoshi Nakamoto).

# Projects

### Institute Map

Every year parents arrives at LNMIIT to get their childrens enrolled,being a vast campus of 100 acres with huge infrastructure certainly arises problems.Peoples during their first visits tend to get lost or could not locate certain place.In this project we collected data of 7 different locations of LNMIIT, trained on different classifiers, and deployed an app on [heroku](https://herokuapp.com).With this app, user just need to input its surrounding image, and it will recognises the input image with the ML code running on servers.Then they will be directed to LNMIIT map with their current location, user can also seek route between two location on the map.This is a detailed [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hKfg-HvGp5Ig-I96A8APbMGFkrJR_WZpYwJ2GV0ABY4/edit?usp=sharing).

### Shallow NN code from scratch
Implemented neural-network code from scratch using python.When tested on MNIST dataset my 2 layer network attained an accuracy of ~92%.You can find the implemented code [here](https://github.com/blitu12345/kaggle/blob/master/MNIST).

### HandWritten Digit Recognition
Digit Recognition challenge on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) is considered to be base model for beginners to learn about computer vision.So did I,whereas instead of using any deep learning frame work i used Machine learning multi class classification models like Logistic regression, SVM, KNN with help of sklearn.Code can be found [here](https://github.com/blitu12345/kaggle/tree/master/digitRecognition).

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle.
Binary classification problem, based on information about Titanic passengers task is to predict whether a person on titanic survived or not.General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Prediction of likelihood of survival of passengers and obtain an accuracy of 81.34%,within top 7%.Used several models like Logistic Regression,SVM and Decision tress,but after performing data analysis and feature extraction its seems RandomForest Classifier results performed well on all evaluation metrics.Code can be found [here](https://github.com/blitu12345/kaggle/tree/master/titanic).

### Loan Prediction
To help Indessa Bank identify default members(unable to satisfy terms of loan).We were provided with dataset containing 1 lakh members detail and with 45 features each.While developing my model, i have applied feature engineering, statistical test (like chi-square test ,t-test and Pearson correlation),visualisation techniques(box plot,scatter plot,histogram and bar chart) and finally applied some fine ML algorithms(Logistic Regression,Random Forest and XGBoost).I was able to secure a rank within top 4% of users.Code canbe found [here](https://github.com/blitu12345/-Bank-Fears-Loanliness)

### Clustering-species

Clustering is an approach to unsupervised machine learning. Clustering with KMeans is one of algorithms of clustering.But to clustering a variety of species requires higher understanding of machine learning algos.I have used variuos approaches like elbow methoda and hiearchical clustering methods to understand this high dimensional data.Implementation is available [here](https://github.com/blitu12345/Cluster-Species).

### Content-based recommender system 
Implemented a content based recommender system to recoomend genre, books for user for a typical bookstore website.Code can be found [here](https://github.com/blitu12345/Recommender-system).

### The Cab Service
Contest held on [hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/machine-learning-indiahacks-2017/), aimed to help company predict the trip fare amount using modern Machine Learning approaches.Code can be found [here](help company to predict the trip fare amount)

### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on information about houses we predict their prices. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
Used Supervised Learning methods to predict Boston house prices. With ensemble modelling and feature engineering my model was finally able to predict prices with high confidence.


### DeepLearning Implementations with Tensorflow and Pytorch
1. Handwritten digit recognition on MNIST implemented using tensorflow.Code can be found [here](https://github.com/blitu12345/Code-With-DL/tree/master/tensorflow/Convnets)
2. Implemented logistic regression using Tensorflow.Code can be found [here](https://github.com/blitu12345/Code-With-DL/tree/master/tensorflow/logistic%20regression%20examples)
3. Implemented linear regression using Tensorflow. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/blitu12345/Code-With-DL/tree/master/tensorflow/linear_regression_examples)
4. Implemented Shallow neural network in pytorch.Code can be found [here](https://github.com/blitu12345/Code-With-DL/tree/master/pytorch).

### Cats vs Dogs
In this [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats), we had to write an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.I have implemented a VGG net from scratch and also used pretrained weights in keras to solve this problem.Code can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/blitu12345/deepcodesbase/src/b18ad9bfe9b7280fe694791f085dfcfbd69cd1cb/CatsandDogs/?at=master).

# Experiences

### Deep learning Engineer Intern at SilverSparro, Gurgaon.
Silversparro provides Artificial intelligence solutions to enterprises, retailers and distributors.I worked on :-
1. implementing state of the art research papers for image segmentation, localization and detection to improve existing OCR models.
2. data analysis, preprocessing on data(>40gb) and build ML model.
3. speech recognition for a large e-commerce company on customer service recordings.

### Talk on Mask-RCNN on Image-Segmentation.
I had delivered a talk on State of the art image segmentation paper published by Facebook's FAIR Mask-RCNN.Report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13tW8yzSrJy5EglmkPqpKS_Fg5GMvY77CmsbAzdGm4n0/edit?usp=sharing).

### NVIDIA Developer Conference
Participated at NVIDIA's developer conference held at mumbai.THis conference was aimed to bring all developers together and discuss current technologies in Deep learning and how industries utilises them.

### Sub-coordinator Of ML/DL/DS club 
I'm currently acting sub-coodinator of ML/DS/DL of CYBROS a technical community club at LNMIIT, helping students at LNMIIT to advance in machine learning field.
