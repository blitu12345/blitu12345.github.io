Hi, my name is Ashish Karel.


<p>
I am an avid manga reader, sci-fi reader, and loves to run my current PA is 2.1km/7minutes. I love to learn about how things work, whether that be studying good coding practices, engineering techniques, or machine learning methods. Much of my experience revolves around building machine learning applications, but I also strive to gain a deeper understanding of the world so that I can expand my skillset and build new and amazing things.

# Get to Know Me 
  
Computer Vision engineer with extensive experiecne of around 2 years in designing and developing multiple large-scale products in Computer Vision and Deep Learning domain, in an end-to-end manner.

As a Pattern Recognition enthusiast,I also have some experience in NLP(Natural Language Processing) and ASR(Automatic Speech Recognition).

* Well-versed with python, c, c++, data-structres and algorithms
* Experienced with frameworks including Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras
* Skilled in Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning, software developemnt skills
* High familarity with libraries such as OpenCV, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, SkLearn, Flask, DLib, QT and version control tool such as Git.
* Experienced working on Unix and Microsoft OS, and exposure to Raspbian OS and embedded hardware such as Raspberry Pi and Nvidia Jetson Nano.
* Exposed to model optimization techniques using TensorRT, OpenVino, Tflite and other frameworks.
* Exposed to web services such as AWS, Google cloud, Azure and Heroku 

* Computer Vision applications : object detection, object classification, face detection and recognition, handwriting detection, OCR, object tracking ,image search,  motion analysis, keyframe extraction.
* NLP             applications : Information retrieval and summarizer .
* Deep Learning           models : VGG-16, Resnet, InceptionNet, Mobilenet, Yolo, ssd-resnet10, ssd-mobilenetv2, U-net, Siamese Network, MaskedRCNN, FlowNet, 
* Image Processing    algorithms : HoG, SURF, SIFT, LBP, Canny Edge Detector, Optical Flow, Filters, background-subtraction, 
* Machine Learning    algorithms : SVM, Decision Trees, KMeans, KNN, Dbscan, TF-IDF, LDF, BoV, 

My research papers addresses the problem of activity recognition in cricket trimmed videos, and describes how we used semi-supervised approach and intergrating ideas from NLP and image processing to tackle the problem. 

Having worked on multiple developemnt and research projects, I find myself well equipped with research and project management skills that are necessary for AI based roles, and hence, I'm looking forward for such roles where I can create a positive impact and solve real world problems.

## The LNM Institute Of Information Technology

* ***Institute Map***
	*  Guidance mobile app for people's first visit(like parents, new joinee and admission students) to LNMIIT being a vast campus of 100 acres with huge infrastructure . 
	*  In this project we collected multiple images of 7 different locations of LNMIIT .
	*  With this app, user just need to input its surrounding image, and it will recognises the input image, this can locate and guide user to pinned location in college map.
	*  Api creation using flask, and deployed on [heroku](https://herokuapp.com)
	*  This is a detailed [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hKfg-HvGp5Ig-I96A8APbMGFkrJR_WZpYwJ2GV0ABY4/edit?usp=sharing).
